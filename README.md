# MIPS-16-Pipeline
Starting from a simplified version of the MIPS instruction set architecture (ISA) which finds the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) between two elements from an array with given indexes, this repository contains an implementation of the MIPS 16 Pipeline that extends the Single Cycle version. Although it is faster than the single cycle version, in the pipeline version of MIPS microprocessor can occur structural, data, or control hazards that prevent the flow of execution. Using techniques such as stalling and a hardware technique for the Register File, I assured that the program works perfectly fine.
